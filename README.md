<h1 align="center"> My Personal Website </h1>
This is the repository used to build my personal website. My personal website was one of my first major coding endeavors. It originally served as a portfolio for potential clients and employers. Now its my creative outlet to share my thoughts and experiences with the world. Check it out at https://patrickpiedad.me/

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Netlify, Astro
<br></br>
The base template is pulled from the starter Astro themes, specifically Nordlys found at https://github.com/FjellOverflow/nordlys, which gave a great starting point for the website.

<h1 align="center"> Lessons Learned </h1>
Moving out my website from an 11ty static site generation format to Astro was extremely easy. I've learned the importance of good documentation (like Astro's) and how it can make migrations and onboarding seamless.
