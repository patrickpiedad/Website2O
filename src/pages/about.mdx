## <center>My Story</center>

I grew up in the United States, moving towns from sunny California, to small town West Virginia, and finally to big city Virginia.

Throughout my upbringing, I found a love for academics and athletics. I was quite proud of my identity as a "student-athlete," finding a balance between smarts and physical training.

This led me to attending the Virginia Military Institute on a US Army scholarship, majoring in Physics and working towards my future as an Armor and Intelligence Officer.

I spent most of my military career stationed in Bavaria, Germany, working alongside NATO and allied partner forces.

It is also here where I met my beautiful wife, Theresa. After a rewarding military career and serving for nearly 9 years, we decided that we would leave the military life behind and put our roots down here in Germany.

In the transition, I found myself feeling like a kid again, trying to figure out what I wanted to do when I grew up.

Through a lot of self reflection and working to figure out what I really enjoyed in my military career, I found myself turning to tech.

Fast forward and I am happily using my software development and project management skills for both professional and personal endeavors.

I developed this website to serve as a creative outlet for myself, sharing my thoughts, experiences, and personal projects.

Thanks for being here and welcome to my corner of the internet.
