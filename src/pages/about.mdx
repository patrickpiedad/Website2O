## <center>My Story</center>

I went to university on a United States Army scholarship, solidifying my future as both an Armor and Intelligence Officer.

I spent most of my military career stationed in Bavaria, Germany, where I met my beautiful wife, Theresa. After getting married, we decided that I would leave the military and we would put our roots down, here in Germany.

As a result, I needed to find a new career that I could pursue, that would also give me the passion and drive that I found serving.

After a lot of self reflection, working to figure out what I really enjoyed in my military career, I found myself turning to tech.

Fast forward a bit, I am happily using my software development and technical project management background to solve challenging problems.

This journey has taken me through the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy, also known as MSSA, and landing my current role in Cloud.

As I begin this next season of life, I look forward to growing with a new team in an exciting environment.
