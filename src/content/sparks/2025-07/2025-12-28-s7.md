I started "Morning Pages" today, the journaling practice of writing a number of pages in the morning (3x pages recommended). Some people use it to help solidify their dreams and goals, while others, me included, hope it will "declutter" everything going on in my head. In my writing today, I used the phrase "not just processing in my head, by renedering to paper with a kind of finality."

Nothing like writing a spark about a journal entry to start out the day.
