I decided to keep the layout of Sparks for now using the normal collection process that my blogs and projects use, with the small edits to the schema, since it only needs a publish date and the markdown. 

I think the SSG power of Astro negates the issue (at least for now) with a large number of content markdown files. I'll organize my sparks by month in a folder, and this allows for the flexibility to keep my Sparks separate without having to hard-type dates.

Next feature will be figuring out infinite scrolling to replace the pagination for my Sparks page. Pagination makes a lot of sense for blog posts and even projects, but for Sparks, the infinite scrolling would be much better.
