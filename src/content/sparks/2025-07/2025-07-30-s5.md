I wanted to see what using AI to code is like in its current state, so I bought a Claude Code Pro subscription.

While the code is definitely not clean or organized in a best practice way, I was able to get a working app running in a few days, something that would have taken me much at least few weeks.

The app will be used for our wedding to allow our guests to upload pictures and videos, as well as download them later.

Plenty of apps exist for this, but they usually have limitations or require a pretty penny to be spent (because weddings...).

Now my wife and I have our own privte app that (should) work great for the big day. Super stoked!

The AI usage is a skill in itself, so I'd recommend everyone getting some experience with prompting, using the built in context support, and generally getting a feel of AI's capability and limitations when it comes to coding.

There's no better way to demystify AI than to use it in a project.
