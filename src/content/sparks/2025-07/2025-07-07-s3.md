For me, I have to re-learn how the JavaScript engine and runtimes work. [Here's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-engine-and-runtime-explained/) what I used to refresh the memory this morning.

Also, my next few tweaks to the Sparks feature of my website is going to be how I add Sparks. Right now its another Spark file (markdown), just like my blog posts and project posts. However, I think (at least for now, without an integrated CMS), 

I'm going to rewrite a few things so that I can just add Sparks to the same markdown file, maybe organized by month, and the date of each Spark will just be read from that file.

Let's see how that goes.
