In efforts to broaden my blog's scope, I wanted to share that I recently started coaching my local CrossFit box! I must say, having a hobby outside of the tech/IT world gives a great change of pace. CrossFit has been a part of my life since I started in 2018, however this is the first time that I'm taking on a coach role.

After leaving the military, I've noticed a missing feeling of fulfillment that came from serving my soldiers. After reflecting on the coaching role, I think it could bring that feeling of fulfillment back, helping people reach their goals, move better, and become healthier.

Schau ma mal!
