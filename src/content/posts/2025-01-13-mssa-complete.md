##  Introduction

Welcome to the third and final installment in my blog series, "My MSSA Experience." If you don't know what MSSA is, check out the first article in the series, <a href="https://patrickpiedad.netlify.app/blog/2024-07-27-what-is-mssa/">"What is MSSA?"</a>

In this final article, we'll break down my experience in the Cloud Application Development pathway into the following sections:

- Help Me Be Not Unemployed
- My Honest Take

Let's dive in.

##  The Technical Stuff

As you'll remember from previous articles, the Cloud Application Development pathway teaches you a software development oriented skill set with C# as the target language and Microsoft Azure as the target cloud provider.

My cohort had a mix of experience, from 100% beginners to people with CS degrees and years of programming under their belt.

The technical curriculum looks like the following:

### Curriculum Schedule
- Intro to Programming & GitHub (2 Weeks)
- Programming in C# Part 1 (2 Weeks)
- Data Structures & Algorithms (4 Weeks)
- Programming in C# Part 2 (2 Weeks)
- .NET MAUI (2 Weeks)
- Project Week & Technical Interviews (1 Week)
- AZ-900 / AI-900 (1 Week)
- AZ-204 (2 Weeks)

This covers 16/17 weeks of the program, with Fridays and the one week in the middle being devoted to Professional Development.

The program strives to take you from a beginner to "hireable" within these 16 weeks.

## My Honest Take

Let's go ahead and put this point out there.

***This isn't enough.***

I know, heartbreaking.

***"But Pat, I thought MSSA is supposed to take me from a freedom-defending military dude or dudette straight into a six-figure salaried tech role!?"***

For some people, it absolutely will.

But those people will likely already have other certifications, degrees, experience, and a strong network they can leverage, in addition to the skills developed through MSSA.

If you don't have these things, then you will naturally have a bigger mountain to climb in landing your first role.

My cohort was filled with incredibly intelligent individuals. I was floored by the talent that existed in our group, and quite often intimidated by how well they grasped the concepts. I would have gladly worked alongside every single one of these individuals.

And yet, my cohort struggled to land roles after graduating the program.

It would be unfair to omit that our cohort end date of November was not the well timed with hiring cycles, as well as our job search timeline being deep in what was generally accepted as a "really tough market" at the end of 2024.

However, it would also be unfair to say that MSSA guarantees you a role out of the gate.

***So you're saying that MSSA isn't worth it?***

Not at all.

I would absolutely go through the program again.

For me, it gave me the time and skill set needed to land a job prior to graduation. But I had a few other things going for me, such as a Bachelor of Science in Physics, an active PMP certification, and a self-taught background in JavaScript.

And even if you're not in a similar situation, I still highly recommend the program to the general military community.

I would also caveat that you should take stock of what your goals are post-military, what you already have to offer an employer, and what you can feasibly accomplish before applying to roles.

I know, that's very intangible, and I am a fan of quantifiable data. So, I'll say this:

The MSSA CAD pathway can get a beginner, with no prior programming exposure, to 70% of a hirable junior software developer, granted they put in the hard work during the program.

Saying that another way, if you have no other experience or skills to offer an employer, outside of what MSSA teaches you, you will fall short of the bar to be hired as software developer.

***Well that's depressing.***

In a way, yes. But it is also understandable.

University students study computer science for 4 years, with multiple summer internships, hoping to land a software developer role after graduating.

I would say that creating a 17 week program that can match that 4 year experience is tough sell.

I am not saying that you need a college degree to land a job.

I am not saying that you need 3-5 years of developer experience prior to transitioning out of the military to get a role a software developer.

I am not saying that you need all the available Azure and AWS certifications to land a role in cloud.

I am saying that there is a proverbial bar that you need to reach to be hirable.

I am saying that all these things greatly improve your chances in a job market saturated with candidates with these qualifications and more.

I am saying that MSSA gives you a great set of technical and professional skills to augment your ability to apply for and land roles.

***In essence, I am saying that MSSA will get you a good part of the way, and it is on you to do more and get yourself to the finish line.***

Here's my list of "more" to do while in MSSA:

1. Get an intermediate level cloud certification such as AZ-104 / AZ-204 or AWS-SAA
2. Develop and publish a working project on GitHub or personal website
3. Drill Data Structures and Algorithms with a goal to be able to solve all easy, most medium, and a handful of hard LeetCode problems.
4. Do every mock interview you are offered
5. Meaningfully network on LinkedIn with techies in your target areas and have an online presence

## Conclusion

I got lucky in my job search. And by lucky, I mean in the sense of "preparation meets opportunity."

Out of 70+ applications submitted, I landed five interviews, and two job offers, all in a country where I only had an intermediate level of the native language.



Cheers,\
Pat
