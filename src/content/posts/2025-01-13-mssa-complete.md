##  Introduction

Welcome to the third and final installment in my blog series, "My MSSA Experience." If you don't know what MSSA is, check out the first article in the series, <a href="https://patrickpiedad.me/posts/2024-07-27-what-is-mssa/">"What is MSSA?"</a>

In this final article, we'll break down my experience in the Cloud Application Development pathway into the following sections:

- The Technical Stuff 
- ProDev Learning
- Help Me Be Not Unemployed
- My Honest Take

Let's dive in.

##  The Technical Stuff

As you'll remember from previous articles, the Cloud Application Development pathway teaches you a software development oriented skill set with C# as the target language and Microsoft Azure as the target cloud provider.

My cohort had a mix of experience, from 100% beginners to people with CS degrees and years of programming under their belt.

My cohort's technical curriculum schedule looked like the following:

### Curriculum Schedule
- Intro to Programming & GitHub (2 Weeks)
- Programming in C# Part 1 (2 Weeks)
- Data Structures & Algorithms (4 Weeks)
- Professional Development Week [Non-Technical Instruction] (1 Week)
- Programming in C# Part 2 (2 Weeks)
- .NET MAUI (2 Weeks)
- Project Week & Technical Interviews (1 Week)
- AZ-900 / AI-900 (1 Week)
- AZ-204 (2 Weeks)

Our technical instruction covered 16/17 weeks of the program, with Fridays and one week in the middle being devoted to Professional Development.

Below is a further breakdown of the curriculum, grouped by topic instead of chronological order.

### C# Learning (Parts 1 & 2)

- Basic computer data storage and processing
- Thinking like a computer
- Basic fundamentals such as data types, variables, constants, arrays, functions/methods, and loops
- Structs, classes, value types, reference types
- Exception handling
- Object Oriented Programming concepts
- C# libraries and LINQ
- Console apps used as the basis to test applications
- Windows Forms
- Databases, SQL, and Entity Framework

This curriculum brought us from zero programming to being able to develop create-read-update-delete (CRUD) applications.

I'll admit, this amount of instruction was overwhelming to digest and I didn't understand it fully, especially in the first few weeks. 

That was okay. The deeper understanding came with time. Just keep at it.

### Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Arrays (single, two, and multi-dimensional)
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- String operations
- Recursion
- Algorithm types and differences
- Linear and Binary Search
- Selection, Bubble, Insertion, Shell, Quick, and Merge Sort
- Binary Trees and Traversal
- Time vs Space Complexity, Big-O Notation

Feedback from MSSA's hiring partners showed that DSA was the biggest weakness of applicants. This portion of the course was added in efforts for MSSA to tailor their participants to the demands of the market.

This content was just as important as it was difficult to grasp. We progressed very quickly in these four weeks and the knowledge was the foundation to be able to tackle infamous LeetCode problem sets, critical for technical interviews.

If you don't understand what's going on during this portion of the course, ask questions. More than the pure C# portions, DSA learning benefits greatly from walking through problems with a skilled developer.

### .NET MAUI
- Functionality and architecture of .NET MAUI 
- XAML
- MVVM architecture

This portion of the course was relatively short compared to the other curriculum, but was the first "framework" that we learned.

Depending on where you live, the demand for this framework may be lower than other frameworks like React (JavaScript) or Spring (Java).

If you end up liking .NET MAUI, you can use this knowledge to deploy your apps cross-platform. We had cohort members deploy their projects to mobile, which was really inspiring to see.

I took this portion as an opportunity to see how "a" framework works, as I knew other frameworks would use similar concepts for developing applications.

### AZ-204 Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure

This part of the course gave the basis for the "cloud" portion of the cohort.

We had a number of interactive labs that allowed for us to configure services in an Azure environment. This is where "coding" took more of a backseat and we focused on "architecting," how we could use cloud to deploy our applications.

This included all primary services of Azure such as Blog Storage, Functions, and Cosmos DB. This also went into EntraID and how it could be used for security purposes in our cloud-based applications.

We did not learn everything needed to pass AZ-204. This served more of a strong starting point. I'd estimate self study for another 2-3 months before being ready for the exam.

### Mini & Final Project
- Description of mini project requirements, show basic CRUD functionality
- Description of final project requirements, integrate database and expand features in Windows Forms, .NET MAUI, or Blazor
- Opting to do mini-project and final project as same idea but expanded

Our cohort had a mini-project and final-project as part of the curriculum.

The mini-project was meant to be bring together everything learned in the first half of the course, prior to professional development week. The majority of our projects was a simple CRUD application using Windows Forms and the built in storage that Windows Forms deployed with.

The final-project is meant to bring together all of our learning through that point, which was 3-4 weeks prior to graduation. These projects mostly featured .NET MAUI or Blazor based applications, both frameworks in the .NET ecosystem, and integrating an external database.

I would recommend thinking about your project idea early. I benefited from making a small prototype of my application for my mini-project, and then expanding upon it for the final project. This let me keep a frame of reference and have a solid project with 100+ hours of work to showcase to employers.

### Certifications

Below is a list of certifications that my cohort targeted during the program.

- AZ-900
- AI-900
- AZ-104
- AZ-204
- Security+

We received 1x voucher for a Microsoft certificate of our choice, which was quite nice to have.

I ended up getting my AZ-900 certification, which served as a small cloud certificate to show a baseline of knowledge to employers. This was, by no means, a certificate that would land me a role, but it possibly gave an edge over another candidate with a similar profile.

I would highly recommend deciding what certificate you want to go for in the first few weeks of your program, then begin studying. 

We ran into the problem of having started our certificate preparation too late, and therefore not having them for initial job applications.

To give a tangible goal, I believe that AZ-900, AI-900, and AZ-104 are reachable targets during the cohort, as long as you start early.

Side Note: Security+ is on this list because its usually required for any government-focused roles. You won't receive any instruction or vouchers for this certificate through the program, but it is also reachable during the cohort timeline.

### Technical Instructors

We had a total of four instructors, all being official Microsoft Certified Trainers.

My cohort found that our MSSA experience varied based on our instructor. 

All the instructors met a minimum qualification, but like all teachers in the world, they each had their unique style to teaching.

Some were very "textbook heavy," relying on the instruction material to lead the curriculum, while others developed their own curriculum on each approved topic, based on their own experiences in tech.

I was personally a fan of the self-made curriculum, as it gave a feel of practicality and liveliness to the instruction.

Whatever style your instructor has, ***you need to ask questions on anything you don't understand.*** 

All of the instructors will happily take the time to help you. There were plenty bits of "project time" where 1:1 sessions were encouraged.

I'm serious, ask your questions. If your question is answered, but you are still unclear, ask another question. Keep asking questions until you get the concept.

It might seem annoying or even embarrassing for you, but the material will snowball fast if you have holes in your knowledge. This is your transition, maximize the opportunity.

## ProDev Learning

I described Professional Development, colloquially known as "ProDev" as "the other half" of the program. Don't take that as its the less important half either.

We found the ProDev instruction to be as important, if not more important at times, than the technical curriculum.

The military doesn't exactly prepare you for talking about yourself, interviewing, and answer behavioral questions. You'll most likely find that you are quite bad at it.

That's where this portion of the program comes into play. Here's a list of topics that we covered in depth:

- General schedule of Fridays and one week in middle of cohort (week 9)
- Figuring out your personal and professional identities
- Researching desired industries and prospective roles
- Networking
- How to market yourself, resume, cover letter, LinkedIn
- Elevator pitches, interviewing
- Handling the offer
- Mock interview practice

Our program had Fridays set aside for professional development, where we covered one of the topics above. My cohort in particular drilled behavioral questions from the beginning.

By the time we went into the real mock interviews, everyone had improved multiple times over in their targeted story telling and presentation of themselves.

### ProDev Week

During this week, we took a break from all technical instruction and solely focused on professional development.

Let me tell you, it was a much needed break after 8 weeks of drinking C# from the firehose.

This week featured meeting with the other cohorts and working through more mock interviews as well as a host of guest speakers presenting their own takes on the job market, MSSA, and what we should do to get hired.

Our career development manager also brought previous MSSA graduates and recruiters that she had connections with to speak to us. This was incredibly useful and motivating, especially seeing graduates that used to be in our positions, talking about their current tech roles and experience.


### Professional & Technical Mentors

Each cohort is seperated into a handful of groups when it comes to mentorship. Each group will have 3-4 professional mentors and 3-4 technical mentors. The mentorship meetings will rotate each week and cover a variety of topics to reinforce the program curriculum.

This setup is a great advantage, as each of these mentors are subject matter experts in their fields, with many of them also being MSSA graduates. All mentors are current employees are Microsoft and meet certain criteria that qualifies them to advise an MSSA cohort.

These hour long meetings every week gave a great venue to ask any questions we had and get context from mentors that were hiring managers and senior software engineers in the industry.

In my specific case, one of my professional mentors put me in contact with people in his network that could answer my industry specific questions. Making those introductions expanded my knowledge base and made connections that can assist in job hunting in the future.

Overall, these relationships are what you make of it. I recommend utilizing them as much as possible.

## Help Me Be Not Unemployed
- Job searching (The Hunt)
- Job boards
- Hiring Fairs
- Resumer reviews and continued mock interview practice
- Community with cohort and CDM
- Member for life

### Hiring Fairs & Internal Job Boards
Outside of the curriculum provided in the program, MSSA also gives a lot of intangible support and an amount of exposure to internal hiring connections.

Starting with hiring connections, MSSA has an internal job board in which roles with MSSA hiring partners are posted and available for all MSSA members. Ideally, these roles are tailored to MSSA-level applicants.

My cohort unfortunately experienced posted roles in both the job board and hiring fairs that did not apply well to an MSSA applicant's experience level.

Depending on your cohort, you may see or may not see the same results.

### Job Search Support

Moving to more positive notes, our cohort had incredible support from our career development manager. Throughout the cohort and beyond, we had constant support in resume reviews, mock interview practice, and finding referrals for the roles we applied to.

This benefit of the program is ultimately hard to quantify, but paired with the camaraderie that we felt amongst our small group of veterans, we always had a community to fall back on throughout the job search.

When I received my offers, I had immediate support to discuss the offer and talk through any negotiations that I should make. When I receive a 10+ rejections in the course of three days, I had a group of people going through the same rough patches.

The MSSA program provided an incredible opportunity to grow a tight-knit cohort in a small period of time. I'm extremely grateful for the program, especially this particualr aspect of it.

## My Honest Take

Let's go ahead and put this point out there.

***This isn't enough.***

I know, heartbreaking.

***"But Pat, I thought MSSA is supposed to take me from a freedom-defending military dude or dudette straight into a six-figure salaried tech role!?"***

For some people, it absolutely will.

But those people will likely already have other certifications, degrees, experience, and a strong network they can leverage, in addition to the skills developed through MSSA.

If you don't have these things, then you will naturally have a bigger mountain to climb in landing your first role.

My cohort was filled with incredibly intelligent individuals. I was floored by the talent that existed in our group, and quite often intimidated by how well they grasped the concepts. I would have gladly worked alongside every single one of these individuals.

And yet, my cohort struggled to land roles after graduating the program.

It would be unfair to omit that our cohort end date of November was not the well timed with hiring cycles, as well as our job search timeline being deep in what was generally accepted as a "really tough market" at the end of 2024.

However, it would also be unfair to say that MSSA guarantees you a role out of the gate.

***So you're saying that MSSA isn't worth it?***

Not at all.

I would absolutely go through the program again.

For me, it gave me the time and skill set needed to land a job prior to graduation. But I had a few other things going for me, such as a Bachelor of Science in Physics, an active PMP certification, and a self-taught background in JavaScript.

And even if you're not in a similar situation, I still highly recommend the program to the general military community.

I would also caveat that you should take stock of what your goals are post-military, what you already have to offer an employer, and what you can feasibly accomplish before applying to roles.

I know, that's very intangible, and I am a fan of quantifiable data. So, I'll say this:

The MSSA CAD pathway can get a beginner, with no prior programming exposure, to 70% of a hirable junior software developer, granted they put in the hard work during the program.

Saying that another way, if you have no other experience or skills to offer an employer, outside of what MSSA teaches you, you will fall short of the bar to be hired as software developer.

***Well that's depressing.***

In a way, yes. But it is also understandable.

University students study computer science for 4 years, with multiple summer internships, hoping to land a software developer role after graduating.

I would say that creating a 17 week program that can match that 4 year experience is tough sell.

I am not saying that you need a college degree to land a job.

I am not saying that you need 3-5 years of developer experience prior to transitioning out of the military to get a role a software developer.

I am not saying that you need all the available Azure and AWS certifications to land a role in cloud.

I am saying that there is a proverbial bar that you need to reach to be hireable.

I am saying that all these things greatly improve your chances in a job market saturated with candidates with these qualifications and more.

I am saying that MSSA gives you a great set of technical and professional skills to augment your ability to apply for and land roles.

***In essence, I am saying that MSSA will get you a good part of the way, and it is on you to do more and get yourself to the finish line.***

Here's my list of "more" to do while in MSSA:

1. Get an intermediate level cloud certification such as AZ-104 / AZ-204 or AWS-SAA
2. Develop and publish a working project on GitHub or personal website
3. Drill Data Structures and Algorithms with a goal to be able to solve all easy, most medium, and a handful of hard LeetCode problems.
4. Do every mock interview you are offered
5. Meaningfully network on LinkedIn with techies in your target areas and have an online presence

## Conclusion

I got lucky in my job search. And by lucky, I mean in the sense of "preparation meets opportunity."

Out of 70+ applications submitted, I landed five interviews, and two job offers, all in a country where I only had an intermediate level of the native language.



Cheers,\
Pat
