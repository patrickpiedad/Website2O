##  Introduction

Welcome to the second installment in my blog series, "My MSSA Experience." If you don't know what MSSA is, check out the first article in the series, <a href="https://patrickpiedad.me/posts/2024-07-27-what-is-mssa/">"What is MSSA?"</a>

In this article, we'll talk about the application process from eligibility and prerequisites through the interview and cohort start.

Let's jump in.

---

##  Eligibility  

First off, the [MSSA website](https://military.microsoft.com/mssa/how-to-apply/eligibility/">official) is very straight forward and easy to navigate. I will talk about a few of those items below, but the goal of this section is to provide my personal advice for figuring out your eligibility.

There are four categories of people that are eligible for MSSA.

**1. Active-Duty Service Members**
 
This group of people need command approval in accordance with the DoD SkillBridge Program. On the SkillBridge side, regulation requires that you enter SkillBridge status no earlier than 180 days from your official ETS date, NOT your terminal leave date.

For enlisted personnel, this would be the day that your contract officially expires with the military. For officers, this will be your official REFRAD or UQR date.

On the Microsoft side, you are able to apply as long as the program start date is within **210 days of your ETS date**, a 30-day extension to the SkillBridge requirement.

That does NOT mean that you can officially go on "SkillBridge" status 210 days from your ETS date, as that is violating DoD regulation, but rather you can take personal leave to begin the program up to 210 days from your ETS date, and officially go on SkillBridge status at the 180-day mark.

That's a nuanced point, so if that applies to you, read it a few times until you're sure you understand it.

This is all command-dependent, but worth exploring if this allows for you to apply for a better timed MSSA cohort.

Additionally, Microsoft is not responsible for helping you through the SkillBridge application process. They will be able to provide select documentation for your packet if needed, and the MSSA Operations Team is incredible at responding to your questions, but it is your job to secure approval from your command.
For specific documentation requirements, take a look at the <a href="https://military.microsoft.com/mssa/faqs/#ELIGIBILITY">FAQ section</a> of the MSSA website.

**2. Veterans**

Fortunately, veterans have a much easier "eligibility" check than active duty service members. The only documentation required is your DD-214 showing either an Honorable or General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions on their Character of Service.

There is no time limitation for when you transitioned from the military or age restriction. Cohorts have members from first-term Soldiers to 25-year military retirees.

The biggest point for non-active duty applicants is the securing the ability to fully participate in the 17-week program, as the program is unpaid and full-time hours. Make sure to talk to your current employer and/or have a financial plan in place.

**3. National Guard / Reserves**

For my National Guardsmen / Reservists out there, you're in the middle of the spectrum. You will need command approval to apply for the program, but are not limited to the 180-day from ETS time restriction.

As with the veterans group, you'll need to ensure you talk with your current employer, your chain of command, and/or have a financial plan in place for the 17-week full-time program.

**4. Military Spouses**

At the time of writing this post, the Military Spouse program is gearing up for its first cohort execution. The program will focus on preparing military spouses to be successful in Technical Program Management.

You'll be required to submit proof of your spouse's status as either an active duty service member or veteran, provide proof of a high school diploma or equivalent, and provide your basic contact information in your application.

The bulk of information can be found on the <a href="https://military.microsoft.com/mssa/militaryspouse/">Military Spouse Program page.</a>

## Full Time Commitment 

I touched briefly on this portion in the above section, but it's worth emphasizing.

If you are applying to MSSA, you should be ready to posture yourself for a full time, 17-week commitment.

The program can be very challenging, depending on where you are with the material. While not required, the program tends to demand work outside of program hours, from technical training, networking, and interviewing.

The experience is a really rewarding one. Take full advantage of it by creating the space to immerse yourself in the program.

## LinkedIn Learning Paths

Each pathway requires a certificate from its corresponding LinkedIn Learning Path. Take a look at the <a href="https://military.microsoft.com/mssa/how-to-apply/prerequiste-certifications/">website</a> for your specific learning path name.

The learning paths are meant to expose you to the material that you'll be learning during the program. This is especially important if you have little to no experience in the field, which is likely most applicants!

On average, each path can take anywhere from 20 to 30 hours of work. Once complete with the training, you will be able to download your completion certificate stating the number of hours you took to complete it. There's no need to rush, and you should take the time to familiarize yourself with the material.

I will say, the LinkedIn Learning Paths can be a lot of information to digest and will not cover every fundamental that you need to know. Since it is required for your complete application (not your initial submission), I'd suggest completing this as soon as possible, then utilizing other resources to solidify your fundamentals.

Also, access to LinkedIn Learning and the learning paths require LinkedIn Premium. Fortunately, all military service members, veterans, and military spouses are eligible for one free year of LinkedIn Premium, assuming you haven't used this benefit before. Check out the <a href="https://socialimpact.linkedin.com/programs/veterans/premiumform">Military Members</a> and <a href="https://socialimpact.linkedin.com/programs/veterans/milspouses">Military Spouses</a> links.

## Application Timeline (Part 1)

Ah yes, the application timeline. Here's where the fun begins.

This <a href="https://military.microsoft.com/mssa/how-to-apply/#5-admissions-timeline">timeline</a> is great and gives you all the key dates you need. So instead of reiterating all of that information, I'll give you what I did during my application process:

### 2 Years Out

Yes, you read that right.

No, I did not know that I wanted to apply to MSSA two years out.

Yes, I did know that I was going to transition out of the Army and began socializing the idea of doing a SkillBridge.

Your results may vary, but this was instrumental in securing my DoD SkillBridge opportunity with my command.

***Key Takeaway: Start thinking about what it'll take to commit to MSSA. No matter your status, it takes time to plan out your commitment.***


### 9 Months Out

I learned about MSSA through exploration of the DoD SkillBridge website and put it at the top of my list for possible SkillBridge options.

***Key Takeaway: Explore all the SkillBridge opportunities out there. MSSA is only one of them, and it's extremely selective. Don't put yourself in a position to miss out on SkillBridge because you only applied to one.***

### 7 Months Out

One of my close friends and I, (hi Joe), started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on our own. This learning was completely unrelated to MSSA.

So why am I mentioning it in this timeline?

MSSA is not geared towards "already-industry experts" in the tech world.

It is geared towards service members, veterans, and military spouses that are **PASSIONATE** about transitioning into the tech industry, in spite of limited expertise.

I can honestly say, I am extremely passionate about tech, software development in particular. I was amazed at seeing how technology in the military could make a difference in the world and loved deep diving into the technical details of how it worked.

And so, I started teaching myself how to code.

Little did I know, my initiative to pursue what I was passionate about was exactly what got me into the program.

***Key Takeaway: If you're passionate about getting into the tech world, don't wait until MSSA to start. Start now.***

### 6 Months Out

I began completing all Transition Assistance Program (TAP) requirements.

Since I'm active duty, this was a requirement before I could submit my SkillBridge application to the Army. This can take a few months, depending on your work schedule, and you are technically able to start 12-18 (CONUS / OCONUS) months before your transition date.

I also began my SkillBridge application and the LinkedIn Learning Path, with the goal to complete it PRIOR to application submission. This isn't required, but it can show that you're dedicated to the program by completing it well ahead of materials cut-off time.

***Key Takeaway: If you're active duty, you'll have a lot of things being asked of you while you transition. Knock TAP out early and start on the requirements before the actual window opens up.***

### 5 Months / 20 Weeks Out

The MSSA CAD application window opened! Application windows open for two weeks, starting roughly 20 weeks out from the cohort start date.

The application was relatively straight forward, mainly requiring basic contact information.

There are two parts that you should be ready for.

1. You will need to include what "tech experience" you have.

Now remember, MSSA is for people that are PASSIONATE about tech, not people that are already experts.

Therefore, this portion is really asking, "If you really are passionate about tech, what have you done about it?"

2. You will need to write a short paragraph on why you want to participate in MSSA and enter the tech industry.

Take the time to reflect on the question. It's a short paragraph, but this is likely the first time you're going to actually answer that question in a professional setting.

***Key Takeaway: The reason why matters. Figure out your why.***

### 4 Months / 16 Weeks Out

My application was reviewed for initial eligibility. Once eligibility was confirmed, the rest of my documentation was requested.

Luckily, I already had all of my documentation ready for submission. This took a lot of pressure off of my shoulders as I didn't have to trickle in documents over the course of the next 2 months before the important **materials cutoff date.**

For awareness, once you submit one required document, you will be assigned an application manager to assist you. This is your point of contact that can answer any specific questions you have on your requirements.

After submitting all of my documentation, my file was promptly confirmed, and interview scheduling was made available!

Once you get to this point, you are able to look at the scheduling manager and pick your interview date.

There is no benefit to doing your interview earlier in the process or later. As I understand it, no slotting decisions are allowed to be made until after all interviews are complete.

I ended up scheduling my interview almost immediately because of a shoulder surgery that I was getting soon. It felt great to close out my file early, but I also see the advantage of taking more time to prepare.

***Key Takeaway: Don't rush into your interview if you are not ready. Get your application and materials submitted, then choose an interview date that works for you.***

## The Interview 

I'm not going to talk about the specific interview questions or my personal answers.

Instead, I'll give you advice on how I'd prepare if I had to do it all over again.

It's in list form, because lists are cool.

- The interview is a behavioral interview, not a technical one. That means that the interviewers mainly care about who you are as a person, not about your technical accumen.

- It's a Microsoft program, and Microsoft loves the Situation, Task, Action, and Result (STAR) method. Look it up and learn about it.

- As with any interview, the more you prepare, the better you'll be. Find a good list of sample questions like this <a href="https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-behavioral-interviews">one</a> and practice. Run through questions with your friends, your spouse, your mentor, and that weird guy at the bus stop. You'll be 100x better if you do. 

- Have a list of stories in your head that you know really well. That way, if you get a question that you didn't anticipate, you can adapt one of these stories to answer the question.

- Prove to the interviewers that you're passionate about tech. Tell them about your self-taught journey, those projects you're working on, and the college classes you've been taking. They want you to succeed, so make it easy for them by showing why you're the best candidate.

- This is likely one of your first real interview experiences outside of the military. Relax. This interview matters, but it's also just a conversation between people. In addition to the interviewers screening you as a candidate, make sure you have questions to screen whether the program is what you're looking for.


I could probably write another page and a half of advice, but I'll leave it there. If you are desiring more, reach out and we'll chat.

## Application Timeline (Part 2)

### 3 Months / 12 Weeks Out

Materials cutoff is at the 10-week mark. As I said before, my file was fully closed out at the 16-week mark. However, this is an important timeline to know, so I wanted to emphasize it here.

***Key Takeaway: Do not miss your materials cutoff deadline. Just because you submit your documents by the date, doesn't mean they will meet the requirements and not be kicked back. Give yourself time to make corrections if needed.***

### 2 Months / 8 Weeks Out

Final interviews were taking place during this time. I only checked my email for a decision notification 47x times a day. Pretty good, I think.

### 1.5 Months / 6 Weeks Out

"You have been accepted!"

My first thought? "This is a way better email than I normally get on a Tuesday."

I received my acceptance to the program just under 6 weeks from the cohort start date. This is actually much earlier than the average 3-4 week notification window.

It was definitely a cause for celebration after a long admission process.

## Conclusion
The MSSA application process is not to be taken lightly. You're applying to an extremely selective Microsoft program. If you want to be successful in that application, you'll need to put in the effort.

In the event that you are not selected, don't give up. There are plenty of people that don't make it in the first time but are accepted on their second or even third attempt. If you really want the experience, then keep trying!

In the event that you are selected, congratulations! It's an incredible opportunity and something to be proud of. Keep preparing until cohort start and be ready for the ride!

Until next time.

Cheers,\
Pat
